        **Success**: returns 200 with a JWT in the response body. Client must send this token in the **Authorization** header as `Bearer <token>` on subsequent requests. Using the header (not a cookie) is the standard for APIs and avoids CSRF and cross-origin cookie issues.
        **Failure**: returns 401 with the standard error body (e.g. invalid email or password).
